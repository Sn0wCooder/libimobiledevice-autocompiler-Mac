Hi! With this guide you can easily install libimobiledevice library.

First, you need to install MacPorts, iTunes, Xcode, Command Line Tools and XQuartz.

MacPorts: Yosemite | Mavericks | Mountain Lion | Lion | Snow Leopard | Leopard | Tiger
iTunes: download latest version for Mac here
Xcode: Download from the Mac App Store here or older version on the Apple Developer website here
Command Line Tools: To install it open “installcli.sh” file with Terminal
XQuartz: Download for Mac OS X 10.6 or later here

Following this procedure will not be installed idevicerestore. It is to ve same folder of this file and you can use it on all computers!

First, you need to open Terminal application (Applications>Utilities>Terminal, or you can search it from the Spotlight).
Then type cd folder, where folder is the folder that you have downloaded (type space and drag & drop it). Now:
	•	If you want to compile the source, write ./sourceautocompiler.sh;
	•	If you want to compile the libimobiledevice library, write ./autocompiler.sh.

If during the procedure will be asked for a password, you must enter the Administrator password (while you write it you will not see anything, but you'll be writing correctly!). 

Now wait that the process finishes, it will take a while! Ignore any error during the procedure.

WARNING: The files there will be installed are unique for any computer: if you give it to other people, you will see an error.
